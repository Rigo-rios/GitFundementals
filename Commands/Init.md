# git init

the `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.

if you wanted to create a new directory and intialize a git repository, you can do with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDIrectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```

One inside a git repository, you can start using the commands such as
[Status](./Status.md)
[add](./Add.md)
[commit](./commit.md)
[push](./Push.md)
and more.

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
